This frontend-only Twitter clone is a simplified version of a social media platform. It features a user login page, a home page that displays tweets, and functionality to post new tweets. Data is temporarily stored in the browser using JavaScript, making it a client-side application. The design is responsive and styled with CSS, creating a visually clean interface.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Used:
Array:

Tweets are stored in an array, simulating a feed.
Operations like adding new tweets (push/unshift) and iterating over the feed (forEach) utilize arrays.
String Manipulation:

Validates and processes user inputs, such as trimming spaces from tweets or formatting timestamps.
DOM Manipulation:

Updates the user interface dynamically by interacting with the DOM (e.g., appending tweets to the feed, clearing input fields).
This project doesn't involve complex DSA, as it focuses primarily on frontend functionality and basic data handling.
